Gotta fetcg() 'Em All

Tasks:

1. Locations
+ show the first 20 locations
+ add locations component
+ import to app.js
+ map -> display cities

2. Lets find pokemons
- make the locations clickable/buttons
- if clicked, the locations disappear,
- fetch some pokemons 
- display fetched pokemons (so we see that the fetch was succesful)
- if the location has no pokemons, an error message appears -> back button
